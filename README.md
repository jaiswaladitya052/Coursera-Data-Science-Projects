# **Coursera Guided Projects**
### Note: Stated below are the descriptions of the projects as given on the Coursera website

## [Avoid Overfitting Using Regularization in TensorFlow](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Avoid%20Overfitting%20Using%20Regularization%20in%20TensorFlow)
In this project, you will learn the basics of using weight regularization and dropout regularization to reduce over-fitting in an image classification problem. By the end of this project, you will have created, trained, and evaluated a Neural Network model that, after the training and regularization, will predict image classes of input examples with similar accuracy for both training and validation sets.

## [Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Basic%20Image%20Classification%20with%20TensorFlow)
In this project, you will learn the basics of using Keras with TensorFlow as its backend and use it to solve a basic image classification problem. By the end of this project, you will have created, trained, and evaluated a Neural Network model that will be able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy.

## [Build Multilayer Perceptron Models with Keras](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Build%20Multilayer%20Perceptron%20Models%20with%20Keras)
In this project, you will build and train a multilayer perceptronl (MLP) model using Keras, with Tensorflow as its backend. We will be working with the Reuters dataset, a set of short newswires and their topics, published by Reuters in 1986. It's a very simple, widely used toy dataset for text classification. There are 46 different topics, some of which are more represented than others. But each topic has at least 10 examples in the training set. So in this project, you will build a MLP feed-forward neural network to classify Reuters newswires into 46 different mutually-exclusive topics.

## [Computer Vision - Object Detection with OpenCV and Python](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Computer%20Vision%20-%20Object%20Detection%20with%20OpenCV%20and%20Python)

## [Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Detecting%20COVID-19%20with%20Chest%20X-Ray%20using%20PyTorch)
Use a ResNet-18 model and train it on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset. This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. Our objective in this tutorial is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy.

## [Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Movie%20Recommendation%20System%20using%20Collaborative%20Filtering)
In this project-based course, we will create a recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering with help of `Scikit-surprise` library, which learns from past user behavior. We will be working with a movie lense dataset and by the end of this project, we will be able to give unique movie recommendations for every user based on their past ratings.

## [Medical Diagnosis using Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Medical%20Diagnosis%20using%20Support%20Vector%20Machines)
The dataset we are going to use comes from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**, and contains anonymized diagnostic measurements for a set of female patients.  We will train a **support vector machine** to predict whether a new patient has diabetes based on such measurements.

## [Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning using BERT](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20Deep%20Learning%20using%20BERT)
In this project, you will learn how to analyze a dataset for sentiment analysis. You will learn how to read in a PyTorch BERT model, and adjust the architecture for multi-class classification. You will learn how to adjust an optimizer and scheduler for ideal training and performance. In fine-tuning this model, you will learn how to design a train and evaluate loop to monitor model performance as it trains, including saving and loading models. 

## [Traffic Sign Classification](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Traffic%20Sign%20Classification)
In this hands-on project, we will train deep learning models known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify 43 traffic sign images. This project could be practically applied to self-driving cars. 

In this hands-on project we will go through the following tasks: 

1. Import libraries and datasets 
2. Images visualization
3. Convert images to gray-scale and perform normalization 
4. Build, compile and train deep learning model 
5. Assess trained model performance

## [Understanding Deepfakes with Keras](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Understanding%20Deepfakes%20with%20Keras)
Implement DCGAN or Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network, and you will train the network to generate realistic looking synthesized images. The term Deepfake is typically associated with synthetic data generated by Neural Networks which is similar to real-world, observed data - often with synthesized images, videos or audio. Through this hands-on project, we will go through the details of how such a network is structured, trained, and will ultimately generate synthetic images similar to hand-written digit 0 from the MNIST dataset.
